
To use SUPLOAD to upload Super Mario World type "SUPLOAD S"

The file "S" is an upload script to allow the upload software to
load the Sluggo III memory with the requested files. It contains a list
of filenames or hex addresses to load a file. 

Example of a script.

~2000
FILE2000
~4000
FILE4000
FILENEXT
^Z

Every address is preceded by a "~" symbol followed by a hexadecimal address.
All other lines must contain a valid MS-DOS filename of a file to upload. If
there is no address between filenames then the subsequent file is appended
to the previous file in Sluggo III memory. FILE2000 is loaded at 02000H,
FILE4000 is loaded at 04000H and FILENEXT immediately follows FILE4000. Files
can be uploaded in any order. Separate scripts can be made to upload data 
and/or code separately to help speed up the upload time. The ^Z denotes an
end of file, not an ASCII "^" and a "Z".
